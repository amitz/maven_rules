Graknlabs_ shared their solution for distributing_ artifacts with Bazel. I had to use a leaner POM file template, so I forked the project, removed all but `pom_assemble` code - and created a minimal POM template. I strongly suggested that if you find yourself in this repository, use the original one by Graknlabs.
